# pgwt

Implementation for the Polymer 1.0 elements to be used in GWT projects.
At the moment only a small portion of paper elements are supported, but more will follow.
The elements are primarily designed to be used together with the **Ui-Binder**. 

We aimed to support all actions we would need for a simple user interface, but did not implement 100% of all functions the polymer javascript library provides.
Feel free to improve the code, add your use cases and have fun coding :) 

To checkout how this library looks and feels see our [pgwt showcase](https://github.com/LuxActive/pgwt.showcase).

## 1. Supported elements

## 2. Installation
